Here, you might discuss what previous scholarship has been written about your topic.

You should make sure to investigate..

1. Whatever important *traditional* (non-digital) work has been done on your subject. Because you will want to consider how your project impacts scholarship.
2. Whatever important *digital* work has been done. If you are doing a digital text analysis of Dickens... has Dickens ever been analyzed using text analysis before? What about other authors of his era? Look for other existing digital work that is relevant, even indirectly.

For an example of a scholarship page, [see here](https://confederate-memorials-project.readthedocs.io/en/latest/digital-methods-and-historical-scholarship/).
