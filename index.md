Consult the [Markdown Cheat Sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for Help on using Markdown!

Below are a couple of ways you might include images in your site. The simplest is to use Markdown's image method. Use a !, then put the alt text you want inside of square brackets, and the link inside of parentheses.
![This is the alt text that will appear on mouseover](assets/img/bcds-logo.webp)

If you want to layout two images side by side, you can use Markdown's tables to organize them into a table of two or more columns... you can add rows for captions if you want.

| ![BCDS Logo](assets/img/bcds-logo.webp) | ![BCDS Logo](assets/img/bcds-logo.webp) |
| Caption 1 | Caption 2 |

If you want a single image, center aligned... you have to use raw HTML... use this as a guide, and replace the filename with yours

<p align="center">
    <img src="assets/img/bcds-logo.webp" />
